Hello!

I'm Luke Edwards, a scientific researcher working on MRI of the human brain at the [Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences](https://www.cbs.mpg.de/de) in [Leipzig, Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leipzig).
This is my personal github account where I put code and tools which I want to share because I think they might be useful to other people.
